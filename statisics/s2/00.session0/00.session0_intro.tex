\maketitle

This student book for Pearson Edexcel International A Level Statistics 2 integrates three main themes to support your learning experience:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Mathematical argument, language and proof}: This theme promotes rigorous and consistent approaches throughout the content. Notation boxes are used to explain key mathematical language and symbols [1].
    \item \textbf{Mathematical problem-solving}: The book provides hundreds of problem-solving questions, which are fully integrated into the main exercises. It includes problem-solving boxes that offer tips and strategies, and challenge questions for extra development [1].
    \item \textbf{Transferable skills}: These skills are explicitly embedded throughout the book, appearing in exercises and examples, and are signposted to help students recognize and develop them [1].
\end{enumerate}
The book includes features like learning objectives, prior knowledge checks, step-by-step worked examples, problem-solving boxes, exam-style questions, chapter reviews, and extra online content such as a SolutionBank and calculator tutorials [2, 3].

Below is an overview of the key topics covered in each chapter of the "Mathematics Statistics 2.pdf" student book [4-6]:

\section*{Chapter Overviews}

\subsection*{Chapter 1: Binomial Distributions}
This chapter introduces the \textbf{binomial distribution}, which is a fundamental discrete probability distribution [5, 7, 8]. You will learn about its definition, how to calculate \textbf{cumulative probabilities} for various scenarios, and how to determine the \textbf{mean and variance} of a binomial distribution [5, 9, 10]. It is used when there are a fixed number of trials, two possible outcomes (success/failure), a fixed probability of success, and independent trials [7, 8]. You can model a random variable $X$ with a binomial distribution, denoted $B(n, p)$, where $n$ is the fixed number of trials and $p$ is the fixed probability of success [8]. The mean of $X$ is $np$ and the variance of $X$ is $np(1-p)$ [11, 12].

\subsection*{Chapter 2: Poisson Distributions}
Here, you will explore the \textbf{Poisson distribution}, another key discrete probability distribution [5, 13]. The chapter covers how to \textbf{model real-world situations} using the Poisson distribution, understand its \textbf{additive property} when combining independent Poisson variables, and calculate the \textbf{mean and variance} of a Poisson distribution [5, 14-16]. It is particularly useful for modeling the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, where events occur independently, singly, and at a constant average rate [14, 17]. The mean and variance of a Poisson distribution are both equal to its parameter $\lambda$ [16, 17].

\subsection*{Chapter 3: Approximations}
This chapter delves into \textbf{approximations} between different distributions [5, 18]. You will learn how to use the \textbf{Poisson distribution to approximate the binomial distribution} under certain conditions (large 'n' and small 'p') [5, 19]. Additionally, you will learn to approximate both \textbf{binomial and Poisson distributions using the Normal distribution} when appropriate [5, 20-22]. When using a Normal approximation to a binomial distribution, a continuity correction is needed, and it's valid when $p$ is close to 0.5 [21, 23].

\subsection*{Chapter 4: Continuous Random Variables}
This chapter moves into the realm of \textbf{continuous random variables}, which can take any value within a given range [5, 24, 25]. You will study their \textbf{probability density function} (p.d.f.) and \textbf{cumulative distribution function} (c.d.f.), and learn how to calculate \textbf{measures of location and spread} such as the mean, variance, mode, median, quartiles, and percentiles for these variables [5, 26, 27]. For a continuous random variable $X$, the probability density function $f(x)$ must be non-negative, and the total area under its graph is 1 [25].

\subsection*{Chapter 5: Continuous Uniform Distribution}
A specific type of continuous random variable, the \textbf{continuous uniform distribution}, is the focus of this chapter [5, 28]. You will learn about its properties, how to identify it, and how to \textbf{model real-world situations} where all outcomes within a given interval are equally likely [5, 28, 29]. For a continuous uniform distribution over the interval $[a, b]$, the probability density function is $f(x) = \frac{1}{b-a}$ for $a \leq x \leq b$ and 0 otherwise [28]. The mean is $\frac{a+b}{2}$ and the variance is $\frac{(b-a)^2}{12}$ [30].

\subsection*{Chapter 6: Sampling and Sampling Distributions}
This chapter introduces fundamental concepts in statistics, starting with the distinction between \textbf{populations and samples} [6, 31]. You'll learn about the \textbf{concept of a statistic}, which is a quantity calculated from observations in a sample, and understand how \textbf{sampling distributions} describe the possible values of a statistic and their associated probabilities [6, 32, 33]. A sample is a selection of observations from a subset of the population, used to find out information about the population as a whole [31]. A census, in contrast, observes or measures every member of a population [31].

\subsection*{Chapter 7: Hypothesis Testing}
The final chapter focuses on \textbf{hypothesis testing}, a crucial method for making inferences about a population based on sample data [6, 34]. You will learn how to formulate \textbf{null and alternative hypotheses}, find \textbf{critical values} and \textbf{critical regions}, and conduct \textbf{one-tailed and two-tailed tests} [6, 35-38]. The chapter also covers how to use \textbf{approximations} in hypothesis testing, including testing the mean of a Poisson distribution [6, 39, 40]. A hypothesis test uses a statistic calculated from a sample to test a hypothesis about a population parameter [35].
